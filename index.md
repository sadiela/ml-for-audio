The Machine Learning for Audio Workshop at NeurIPS 2024 will bring together audio practitioners and machine learning researchers to a venue focused on various problems in audio, including music information retrieval, acoustic event detection, bioacoustics, speech transcription, multimodal modeling, and generative modeling of speech and other sounds. Our team has previously held multiple audio-related workshops at top machine learning venues—including a successful version of this workshop at NeurIPS last year—and both the organizing team and invited speakers represent broad diversity in terms of gender identity, affiliation, seniority, and geography. We also plan to solicit workshop papers on the topic.

## Workshop Description
Audio research has recently been enjoying a renaissance of sorts; in the field of audio synthesis alone, many prominent papers have been released in just the last couple of years, with no sign of slowing down. There are numerous additional key problems within the audio research domain that continue to attract widespread attention. Building on this momentum, we ran a workshop last year at NeurIPS on Machine Learning for Audio, and this workshop’s success and the interest it generated has prompted us to organize this workshop again for 2024. We believe that a workshop focused on machine learning in the audio domain would provide a good opportunity to bring together both practitioners of audio tools along with core machine learning researchers interested in audio, in order to foster collaboration and discussion as well as forge new directions within this important area of research. In addition, with the field moving so rapidly, we believe this workshop will provide a dedicated space for the crucial ethical discussions that must be facilitated among researchers around applications of generative machine learning for audio.

**The Machine Learning for Audio workshop at NeurIPS 2024 will cover a broad range of tasks involving audio data. These include, but are not limited to: methods of speech modeling, environmental sound generation or other forms of ambient sound, novel generative models, music generation in the form of raw audio, text-to-speech methods, denoising of speech and music, data augmentation, classification of acoustic events, transcription, source separation, and multimodal problems.**

We will solicit original workshop papers in these areas, which will be reviewed by the organizers and an additional set of reviewers. We will run a demo session alongside a poster session, where contributors will be able to present live demos of their work where applicable. We believe this session will complement the NeurIPS Creative AI Track very nicely; as synthesis is a prominent subfield within audio machine learning research, we will be able to further highlight novel generative methods that do not necessarily overlap with a creative application.

## Call for Papers

We are calling for extended abstracts up to 4 pages excluding references. Accepted submissions will be posted on the workshop website but not published/archived. Several submissions will be chosen for 15-minute contributed talks and the remaining selected submissions will participate in the poster & demo session. Please make sure submissions adhere to the NeurIPS format. Submit your work via CMT (link to provided). The review process will be double-blind so please make sure not to put any author information in your submission.

Authors may also submit supplementary materials along with their papers if they wish (e.g., a preview of a potential demo). Reviewers will not be required to read/view/listen to said supplementary material.
