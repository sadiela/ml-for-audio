The Machine Learning for Audio Workshop at NeurIPS 2023 will bring together audio practitioners and machine learning researchers to a venue focused on various problems in audio, including music information retrieval, acoustic event detection, computational paralinguistics, speech transcription, multimodal modeling, and generative modeling of speech and other sounds.

## Workshop Description
Audio research has recently been enjoying a renaissance of sorts; in the field of audio synthesis alone, many prominent papers have been released in just the past calendar year, with no sign of slowing down. There are numerous additional key problems within the audio research domain that continue to attract widespread attention. We believe that a workshop focused on machine learning in the audio domain would provide a good opportunity to bring together both practitioners of audio tools along with core machine learning researchers interested in audio, in order to foster collaboration and discussion as well as forge new directions within this important area of research. In addition, with the field moving so rapidly, we believe this workshop will provide a dedicated space for the crucial ethical discussions that must be facilitated among researchers around applications of generative machine learning for audio.

**The Machine Learning for Audio workshop at NeurIPS 2023 will cover a broad range of tasks involving audio data. These include, but are not limited to: methods of speech modeling, environmental sound generation or other forms of ambient sound, novel generative models, music generation in the form of raw audio, text-to-speech methods, denoising of speech and music, data augmentation, classification of acoustic events, transcription, source separation, and multimodal problems.**

We plan to solicit original workshop papers in these areas, which will be reviewed by the organizers and an additional set of reviewers. We also plan to run a demo session alongside the poster session, where contributors will be able to present live demos of their work where applicable. We believe this session will complement the newly announced Creative AI Track very nicely; as synthesis is a prominent subfield within audio machine learning research, we will be able to further highlight novel generative methods that do not necessarily overlap with a creative application.

## Data Release 
Recognizing the scarcity of free, publicly available audio data, Modulate and Hume AI will contribute several datasets in the speech domain alongside the workshop, all of large scale for their respective domains. These datasets will include acted speech (professionally acted scripts), spontaneous speech (streamer content), mimicked speech (short-form emotive recordings), and mimicked non-verbal speech. In a pseudo-competition style, each dataset will be described, and baseline results for various audio modeling tasks will be released via a white paper. Further, the white paper will also give a brief overview of other open-source audio data for researchers to explore. The organizers hope this allows researchers from smaller research groups and academia to work with and validate findings on larger, more generalizable datasets.

## Call for Papers

We are calling for extended abstracts up to 4 pages excluding references. Several submissions will be chosen for 15-minute contributed talks and the remaining selected submissions will participate in the poster & demo session. Please make sure submissions adhere to the NeurIPS format. Submit your work via **[CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MLforAudioWorkshop2023)**. The review process will be double-blind so please make sure not to put any author information in your submission.

Authors may also submit supplementary materials along with their papers if they wish (e.g., a preview of a potential demo). Reviewers will not be required to read/view/listen to said supplementary material. 

### Available Data for Workshop Submissions

As part of the workshop, the organizers have made several large-scale audio datasets available. These datasets allow researchers to evaluate a wide range of machine learning approaches.

Two of the datasets can be benchmarked against previous competitions. For more detailed information, you can refer to the following publications:
